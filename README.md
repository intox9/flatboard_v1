# Flatboard v1
Flatboard is a project template folder structure. It's designed to be used for projects which do not use any type of automated version control. Instead, version control and revisions are manually managed. 

Flatboard creates a "flat" folder interpretation of workflow concepts such as branching, tagging, releasing, versioning and revisioning.


### Basic usage
Folders with names wrapped in curly brackets are called *cue folders*. They denote format, naming conventions, and arguments with which to name folders with, which reside in the same folder as the cue folder.
